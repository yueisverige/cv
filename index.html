      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Yue, and I come from Shanghai,China. Before moving to Sweden, I have worked in China for about 9 years including logistics, trading and order management.
        <br>After finishing the Swedish course at Lund university, I chose to study digital analytics at IHM Business School in Malm√∂. 
        <br>As I want to be a technical marketer, that's why I choose to deepen my knowledge in web developer so that I can cooperate with the developer smoothly and can even create my own hobby website, which is cool. 
        <br>In my spare time, I like travelling, photographing and walking in the forest.
